Vending Machines:
---------------------
The main focus of this mod. Vending machines are player controlled markets where you can buy and sell items other players offer up. (not yet implemented. the blocks are all you can get for now) Their crafting recipe requires 4 smooth stone on the corners of the crafting table, one stone button on the right side, a glass block on the top (not dyed), a dropper in the middle, a hopper on the bottom, and a redstone dust on the left side. You can dye them different colors. default color is grey. Two special crafting recipes for my vending machine and Zap's custom vending machine (someone who inspired me to make this mod and helped with the textures. his youtube is linked on the curseforge page for this mod)

Sodas:
----------
Requires Immersive Engineering by BluSunrize to make the cans. 3 aluminum plates in the shape of a bucket and one nugget at the top middle will give you one aluminum can. combine with nether wart, sugar, and one of three dyes (blue, lime, and red) will get you a can of Bepsi, CocaTola, or Mnt View sodas. They give speed and haste for 30 seconds and upon cunsumption, will give you the aluminum can back.

Soda Vending Machines (not yet implemented):
------------------------------------------------
Made with one of any type of vending machine surrounded by either Bepsi, CocaTola, or Mnt View. Can only be filled with their respective sodas. Players determine the price as with all the other vending machines.
